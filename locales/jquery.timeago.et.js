// The above is not a great localization because one would usually
// write "2 minutes ago" in Estonian as "2 minutit tagasi", however
// one would write "2 minutes into the future" as "2 minuti p채rast"
// which cannot be achieved with localization support this simple.
// This is because Estonian has case suffixes attached directly
// to the end of the word). As a workaround, the above localizations
// will say "2 minutit tulevikus" which is understandable but
// not as fluent.
// (Explanation borrowed from Finnish, with adaptations.)
